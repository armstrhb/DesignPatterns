        <p>Common Software Patterns, laid out and explained simply.</p>

          <p>All developers have been at this stage at some point in their career.  Some are smart, and begin to yearn for this knowledge early.  Some learn these in class, not understanding their importance outside of their assignments.  And some, like myself, learn these through doing things the hard way first.</p>
          <p>Design Patterns exist for common problems found in software development.  Simple knowledge of the existance of these is a start for the day we live in, when the power of the internet (read google) is at the fingertips of every developer.</p>
          <p>Having in-head knowledge of these structures, and being able to apply them directly without reference, is a big step to removing yourself from code monkey status.</p>
          <p>I've set out to learn the common design patterns out there in the world.  Not just to learn them, but to be able to lay out their ideas, their goals, and the thoughts behind them simply.</p>

          Each Pattern will be laid out and explained.  For each, I'll do the following.

          <h4>An (Extremely) Simple Description</h4>
          <p>As a father of two little boys, I've come to appreciate the skill it takes to explain complex concepts to a small child.</p>
          <p>Each Design Pattern will have a simple description, broken down to a level that a five year old would understand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Further Detail of the Pattern</h4>
          <p>More detail on the problem that this pattern solves, and specifics on how the pattern solves it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Code Examples</h4>
          <p>What's a website about code development without code?</p>
          <p>Examples of the design pattern will be laid out in simple code samples.</p>
